| organization_id | UUID | Yes | FK → organizations.id |
| type | ENUM | Yes | call, email, meeting, demo, lunch, other |
| subject | VARCHAR(255) | Yes | |
| notes | TEXT | No | Outcome note when marking done |
| done | BOOLEAN | Yes | Default false; true = logged activity |
| done_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | Set when done → true |
| due_date | DATE | No | For tasks (done = false) |
| owner_id | UUID | Yes | FK → users.id |
| deal_id | UUID | No | FK → deals.id, SET NULL |
| contact_id | UUID | No | FK → contacts.id, SET NULL |

DB CHECK: `deal_id IS NOT NULL OR contact_id IS NOT NULL OR company_id IS NOT NULL OR lead_id IS NOT NULL`

---

## Critical Constraints

- At least one linked record (DB-level CHECK)
- `done_at` is set once; service prevents changing it after the fact
