## 2. Business Goal

Track the organisations that contacts work for and that deals are being sold into. A company record aggregates all the people and deals at a given account, giving reps full context when engaging an account. Without companies, contacts and deals exist in isolation and account-level visibility is impossible.

- [x] Sales Rep

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Create company
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** create a company record,
**So that** I can group related contacts and deals under one account.

### 4.2 View company list
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** see a list of all companies in the organisation,
**So that** I can navigate to any account quickly.

### 4.3 View company detail
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** open a company and see all its contacts, deals, and activities,
**So that** I have full account context before any engagement.

### 4.4 Edit company
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** update a company's details,
**So that** information such as industry, size, and website stays current.

### 4.5 Delete company
**As an** Admin,
**I want to** soft-delete a company,
**So that** I can remove test or duplicate records without losing linked contact history.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Create company
**Given** a Sales Rep submits the create company form with a name,
**When** the form is submitted,
**Then** the company is created with organization_id set to the submitting user's org and owner_id set to the submitting user.

### AC-02: Company name unique per org
**Given** a company named "Acme Corp" already exists in the organisation,
**When** a user creates a second company with the same name in the same org,
**Then** the system returns 409 with message "A company with this name already exists."

### AC-03: Company list scoped to org
**Given** a logged-in user,
**When** they view the company list,
**Then** they see only non-deleted companies belonging to their organisation.

### AC-04: Company detail shows contacts
**Given** a company has linked contacts,
**When** a user opens the company detail page,
**Then** all contacts with company_id = this company's id are shown in the Contacts tab.

### AC-05: Company detail shows activities
**Given** a company has linked activities,
**When** a user opens the company detail page,
**Then** all activities with company_id = this company's id are shown in the Activities tab.

### AC-06: Soft delete company
**Given** an Admin soft-deletes a company,
**When** the company list is retrieved,
**Then** the deleted company does not appear, but the record exists with deleted_at set.

### AC-07: Contacts unlinked on company delete
**Given** a company with linked contacts is soft-deleted,
**When** the linked contacts are retrieved,
**Then** they still exist and their company_id is null.

## 10. Business Rules

- **BR-01**: Company name must be unique within an organisation. The uniqueness check excludes soft-deleted companies.
- **BR-02**: Deleting a company does not delete its contacts — it only sets their company_id to null (SET NULL).
- **BR-03**: A Sales Rep can only edit companies they own. Managers and Admins can edit any company in the org.
- **BR-04**: Companies are always scoped by organisation_id. No cross-tenant access is possible.
