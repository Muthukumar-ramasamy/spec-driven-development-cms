## 2. Business Goal

Give sales reps a searchable, persistent record of every person they sell to. A contact is the individual human in every deal and conversation. Without contacts, reps have no way to track who they spoke to, when, or what was discussed. The contact record is the anchor for activities, notes, and deals.

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Create contact
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** create a contact record with at minimum a first name,
**So that** I have a permanent record of a person I am selling to.

### 4.2 View contact list
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** see a list of contacts I own,
**So that** I can find who I need to follow up with today.

### 4.3 View all contacts (manager view)
**As a** Manager or Admin,
**I want to** see all contacts in the organisation,
**So that** I have full visibility into the team's relationships.

### 4.4 Search contacts
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** search contacts by name, email, or phone,
**So that** I can find a specific person quickly without scrolling.

### 4.5 View contact detail

**I want to** open a contact and see all their associated deals, activities, and notes,
**So that** I have the full relationship history before a call.

**So that** the record stays accurate as the relationship evolves.

### 4.7 Link contact to company

**So that** I can see all the people at a given account in one place.

### 4.8 Delete contact

**So that** I can remove records created by mistake without losing the history.

**So that** accounts are covered when a team member leaves or changes focus.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Create contact with name only
**Given** a Sales Rep opens the create contact form and enters a first name,
**When** the form is submitted,
**Then** the contact is created with organization_id and owner_id set to the submitting user, and appears in the contact list.

### AC-02: Email uniqueness enforced
**Given** a contact with email `sam@co.com` already exists in the organisation,
**When** a new contact is created with the same email in the same organisation,
**Then** the system returns 409 with message "A contact with this email already exists."

### AC-03: Contact list scoped to org
**Given** a logged-in Sales Rep,
**When** they view the contact list,
**Then** they see only contacts with organization_id matching their JWT.

### AC-04: Sales Rep sees own contacts only
**Given** a user with role sales_rep,
**When** they view the contact list,
**Then** they see only contacts where owner_id = their user ID.

### AC-05: Manager sees all contacts
**Given** a user with role manager or admin,
**When** they view the contact list,
**Then** they see all non-deleted contacts in the organisation.

### AC-06: Search by name
**Given** contacts exist in the organisation,
**When** a user searches by partial name (e.g. "joh"),
**Then** all contacts whose first name or last name contains that string (case-insensitive) are returned.

### AC-07: Link contact to company
**Given** a contact exists and a company exists in the same org,
**When** the contact is edited to set company_id,
**Then** the contact appears in the company's contacts list on the company detail page.

### AC-08: Soft delete
**Given** an Admin soft-deletes a contact,
**When** the contact list is retrieved,
**Then** the deleted contact does not appear, but the record exists in the database with deleted_at set.

### AC-09: Reassign owner
**Given** a Manager updates a contact's owner_id to a different user,
**When** the Sales Rep who now owns it views their contact list,
**Then** that contact appears in their list.

### AC-10: Contact detail shows related records
**Given** a contact has associated deals, activities, and notes,
**When** a user opens the contact detail page,
**Then** all associated deals, activities, and notes are visible in their respective sections.

- **BR-02**: A contact can never be hard-deleted. Deletion always sets deleted_at.
- **BR-03**: A Sales Rep can only edit contacts they own. Managers and Admins can edit any contact in the org.
- **BR-04**: A Sales Rep can only delete their own contacts. Admins can delete any.
- **BR-05**: Contacts are always scoped to the organisation. Cross-tenant access is impossible.
