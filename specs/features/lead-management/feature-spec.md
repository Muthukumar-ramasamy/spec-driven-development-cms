## 2. Business Goal

Capture incoming prospects before they are qualified into a deal. The Leads Inbox is the first stop for every new opportunity — it keeps unqualified prospects separate from the active deal pipeline so reps have a clear qualification queue. Converting a qualified lead creates a deal, ensuring a clean audit trail from first contact to closed revenue.

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Create lead
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** create a lead manually,
**So that** I can capture a new prospect immediately without losing the context.

### 4.2 View leads inbox
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** see all my open leads in a list,
**So that** I can work through my qualification queue efficiently.

### 4.3 View lead detail
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** open a lead and see its full detail, activities, and notes,
**So that** I have context on the prospect before reaching out.

### 4.4 Update lead status
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** change a lead's status (e.g. New → Contacted),
**So that** I can track where it is in the qualification process.

### 4.5 Convert lead to deal
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** convert a qualified lead into a deal in a selected pipeline stage,
**So that** the opportunity enters the sales pipeline.

### 4.6 Disqualify lead
**As a** Sales Rep,
**I want to** disqualify a lead,
**So that** it is removed from my active queue without being deleted.

### 4.7 Filter leads by owner and status
**As a** Manager,
**I want to** filter leads by owner and status,
**So that** I can see which reps have unworked leads that need attention.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Create lead with title
**Given** a Sales Rep opens the create lead form and enters a title,
**When** the form is submitted,
**Then** the lead is created with status = "new" and owner_id = the submitting user.

### AC-02: Leads inbox scoped to org
**Given** a logged-in user,
**When** they view the leads list,
**Then** they see only leads with organization_id matching their JWT.

### AC-03: Sales Rep sees own leads
**Given** a user with role sales_rep,
**When** they view the leads list with default filters,
**Then** they see only leads where owner_id = their user ID.

### AC-04: Default filter excludes disqualified and converted
**Given** the leads inbox is opened with no filters applied,
**When** the list is displayed,
**Then** only leads with status = "new" or status = "contacted" are shown.

### AC-05: Convert lead creates deal
**Given** a Sales Rep selects "Convert to Deal" on a lead and selects a pipeline stage,
**When** they confirm the conversion,
**Then** a deal is created with the lead's title and value, the lead's converted_at is set to now, and lead status becomes "converted".

### AC-06: Converted deal linked to lead
**Given** a lead has been converted,
**When** the lead is viewed,
**Then** the deal created from it is displayed with a link to the deal detail page.

### AC-07: Lead cannot be converted twice
**Given** a lead with status = "converted",
**When** a user attempts to convert it again,
**Then** the system returns 422 with message "This lead has already been converted."

### AC-08: Disqualify lead
**Given** a Sales Rep sets a lead's status to "disqualified",
**When** the leads inbox is viewed with default filters,
**Then** the disqualified lead does not appear.

### AC-09: Manager sees all org leads
**Given** a user with role manager or admin,
**When** they view the leads list,
**Then** they see all non-deleted leads in the organisation (regardless of owner).

---

## 7. Data Requirements

## 9. UI Requirements

| Lead detail drawer | Right-side panel: full lead fields, activities tab, notes tab |

## 10. Business Rules

- **BR-01**: A lead can only be converted once. Attempting to convert a lead with status = "converted" returns 422.
- **BR-02**: A converted lead record is never deleted — it is retained as an audit trail.
- **BR-03**: A lead must have a title. All other fields are optional.
- **BR-04**: The Leads Inbox default view shows only status = "new" and "contacted". Disqualified and converted leads are hidden by default.
- **BR-05**: Lead conversion requires a pipeline stage to be selected — a deal cannot be created without a stage.

| Non-admin deletes lead | 403 "Only admins can delete leads." |

## 14. Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner | Due | Status |
|---|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Should converting a lead automatically link the newly created deal to the lead's contact and company? | Product | — | Resolved: Yes — the deal inherits contact_id and company_id from the lead |
